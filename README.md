# Image Editor - Web App

### [DEMO](https://imageeditordemo.pages.dev)

<font size="5">Depending on your connection, the loading of the canvas may take a few seconds more or less. Still need to add a loading message for user feedback. Some things don't work, please be patient, I'm still working on adding them :D</font>

This is a project that I have been working on for the last two months, it is a web application that edits images, among its features are:
- Rotate image.
- Image scaling.
- Image filtering.
- Adjust brightness, contrast and saturation.
- Add text with styles to the images.
- Overlays.
- Image gallery.

It's not quite finished, I'm still working on it.
